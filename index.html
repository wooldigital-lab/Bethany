2D Project Statement
September 13, 2025
My vision for this 2D logo project of the Southworth Planetarium at the University of Southern Maine, Portland Campus, is to create a modern contemporary design in my logo.  I feel this will appeal to a wider audience of different ages.  Looking at various internet logos, Maine landmarks and Pinterest aesthetic ideas along with the Planetariums website and impact statement helped facilitate my inspiration. I want my design to invoke curiosity, interest and investigation.  Keeping my design simple but impactful I believe gives its composition straightforwardness and clarity. The audience interaction when they look at my logo should be “Wow that looks like something interesting we should check out”.  This could be for a teenage or adult date night, a birthday party, school educational field trip or a fun family learning activity. The shape of my logo is three quarters around with a planet like aesthetic, with a sun and its rays spanning the remaining one quarter of the planet.  I chose an abstract modern style in the images of the adults, adolescent and small child.  On the clothing of the adults are logos of the Maine Lobster representing the State of Maine’s symbolism and the USM logo for the geographical city of Portland symbolism.  I want the audience to see that the Southworth Planetarium is a fun place for educational outreach for all ages and families.  Creating a sense of wonder with their hands in the air as if they are looking to space and the stars (infant with a Saturn balloon). The sun, sunrays and cascading falling stars invite imagination and knowledge exploration, radiating down from space to the audience.  The colors I chose are the strong values, hues and saturations of the Hux Codes of Blue and Gold of USM.  I chose to use those particular colors to accentuate a sense of place, that the Southworth Planetarium is part of the campus in Portland, ME.  My goal for this logo is to promote the Planetarium in a positive, contemporary vibe of interest.  This could be used for advertising purposes on the internet website and advertising platform for the State of Maine, along with the Portland Tourism site.  Gift shop revenue ideas for the logo of  letter head, stationary, t-shirts, hats, pins, postcards, sweatshirts, stickers and on gift cards.

Digital Design Reflection 1
Southworth Planetarium
September 28, 2025
My first Digital Design project was making a Logo for the Southworth Planetarium on the University of Southern Maine’s Portland Campus.  I started to research for ideas and inspiration by looking at their web site for their motto and updated available programming.  I found this very helpful in forming my inspiration for my proposed logo. In searching for ideas from their website I thought about space, our solar system in general and what a planetarium’s purpose is.  I also looked up inspiration on the internet of our solar system and I specifically chose a round logo composition for the planet effect.  The round shape is also in consideration of the inside dome encapsulating our universe. The sunburst that encompasses the upper quarter of the logo was used to emphasize the sun’s place in our solar system;  the elongated sunbeams are meant to enunciate the outreach of the planetarium's solar system education.  I felt this was a very important focal point for the logo, since their focus is on educational outreach.  The open space beyond the upper sunbeams is left blank to suggest the vastness of our universe.  The yellow/gold shooting star juxtaposed on the atmosphere is to promote the exploration and wonder of our skies.  I chose the University of Southern Maine’s School color of blue and gold/yellow to represent the planetarium’s connection and presence at the university. I searched for the color codes on the university web site.  I also researched the Maine connection and a symbol that would be universally recognized as Maine. I chose the symbol of the Maine Lobster as well as the Emblem of the university to represent that the planetarium is on the campus of USM in Maine.  I wanted to specifically connect the educational outreach programs into the logo.  I used white figures of a family with arms raised as if in wonder and excitement enjoying the programming.  The figures range from the father, older child or teen, adolescent and mother holding a toddler.  I chose these particular figures because their programming is for adults, teens, adolescent children, schools and toddlers.  I designed the back of the shirts of the parents with the logos of USM and Maine Lobster.  I did this with the idea of promoting both of those images for local communities and tourism on the internet.  I added the Saturn planet balloon in the toddlers hand to promote fun, a kid friendly atmosphere and accentuate a gift shop opportunity.  The critique I received from classmates was overall very positive.  They all enjoyed the sun/sunbeams as the focal point and liked the round logo composition.  There were differing opinions on the lobster logo, some liked it, others liked it but not the addition of the red color.  They felt the color should be monotone, to be more cohesive.  They all liked the figures and colors I chose to symbolize programming. The Saturn balloon was liked by some, commenting it anchored the symmetry of the logo; others felt it wasn’t accurate in color.  A few comments were given that they really liked my design.  There was a comment that it could be scaled down even more simplified using the sun more as the focal point.  I do agree that these are all changes that would work with the design.  I did not go even simpler with the design for the horizontal, thinking the logo wouldn’t represent the planetarium’s mission of educational outreach for all ages.

Photo Manipulation Proposal
September 29, 2025    Photo Manipulation Proposal   


My first project is my vision of an anti-distopia.  My aesthetics include a scene of death and decay from the dying of our honey bees.  The withering away of human existence, animals and vegetation.  Humans trying to save mankind, shrink themselves to bee size with wings and pollen bags and feed the last few surviving bee larvae in the hive.  There may be mini humans in the honeycomb or human babies as well to bring the effect of symbiosis of the life cycle of the bee with the life cycle of the human race.  I want people to look at my piece, be concerned, saddened and leave a profound sense of action in environmental practices for saving our bees.  I will use color, some repetition of honeycomb and humans.  I will make a quarter of the composition brightly colored, where the humans retrieve the pollen to make honey themselves to feed the larvae.  My mother’s honeybees inspired me to use this as my focus.  Her hives did not survive the winter unfortunately and our gardens were massively affected by the lack of honeybee pollination.   The flowers, vegetables and other crops that depend on the bees for pollination of our entire world rely on the honey bee.  Honey is harvested at our farm organically raw for medicine, food, candles and lip balms. I love bees and enjoy watching them happily foraging pollen in the gardens. A world without bees is a world without humans.  



My other project vision is of a Utopia.  My thoughts are a representation of my spiritual self in my human body, along with my children, in a flowing gown at peace in a field of wildflowers, with loved ones, family, friends and pets spiritual selves come to visit me.  I have always been happiest in nature, in the woods or a secret meadow of wildflowers.  I picture all the love I have and they have for me all encompassing in these spiritual images.  There will be blending of color, some bright, some subdued, space, time and perceived movement of figures and orbs of light.  This is meant to be an ethereal experience of light, love and peace.  There is no pain, no suffering, no sorrow, just peace, light and happiness. I would like people to take away a sense of peace and serenity from this project.   A remembrance of love, compassion and soul.

“Dystopia”

My digital design photo manipulation project was to create what I thought was an example of a Dystopia and a Utopia.   I thought about what a Dystopia would consist of for a concept?   Immediately my thoughts went dark and catastrophic to the human race and every living thing on our planet.  I thought of a current worldwide problem that is starting to reach crucial status in our environment.  Bees came to mind and how crucial they are to every living entity on our planet from the smallest to the largest.  They pollinate the flowers, plants, vegetables, providing honey for medicinal purposes and natural sugar for baking and the food supply.  What would the world look like without bees? What would humans do to keep the last surviving bee larvae alive? How could I show my ideas in a way that would make an impact? A bold strong statement using photo images in such a shocking way that they would bring attention to the vital importance of this issue.  My mom is an apiarist and has up to four hives on our family farm to pollinate our hundred foot greenhouse for organic vegetables, fruits and flowers for our farm stand.  She also sells raw, unfiltered organic honey for cooking and medicinal purposes.  This spring she was devastated when she checked her hives for the second time over winter.  Both of her present hives had died.  We did not have any honey bees except for a few wild ones to pollinate our farm.  This made a huge impact on our gardens, flowers and vegetable production and yield. I started by looking at the uploaded information on Brightspace for constructive ideas.  Then I went to Google Images and the Internet to download pictures and save them onto my desktop for future manipulation on my document.  I looked up Bee references from movies like the “Bee Movie”, word text from food crisis sites along with pictures of starving people and children.  I looked up images of honeycombs, beehives, bees flying, collecting pollen, feeding larvae, baby bees, human skulls, dying bees, emaciated humans and faces of humans with goggles.  I then came up with the idea of humans trying to save the last larvae realizing it was too late and they had to act immediately.   I made layers of the 1000 pixel photo images so I could manipulate them as I needed without destroying the original pixels.  I chose a background of emaciated black human silhouettes. I zoomed in on the photo making the figures closer to the foreground of the composition to look ominous.  I then amplified the red/orange color to look saturated and like a hot, dry and barren landscape and sky.  I then merged the bees with the human heads and shrunk them to fit the bee bodies; to evoke the humans evolving to desperately keep the last remaining bee larvae alive.  I copied and pasted different images of babies from around the world to create a diverse hive.  To show this is a worldwide catastrophe that affects everyone.  The bees feeding the human babies is a metaphor for life and the vital impact bees have on our survival.  I chose vulnerable images to get my point across.  The large waif silhouettes are carrying the last honeycombs with human babies that the bees are trying to save, (metaphorically mankind).  I received a lot of positive comments on my project: how important this subject is and the changes that need to be made to protect the bees and the interconnected life on our planet. How my manipulation of the photo images made the impact I was intending; they could see my dystopia as the narrative I meant to project.






Utopia

My utopia photo manipulation project took a bit of time to think about.  I could have just done it with myself, but instead I chose to use what makes me the happiest in my life.  There are many things that bring joy to my life but my three children are first and foremost my best joy.  They are my heart and soul. There has been alot of joy and alot of pain in my family losing people we loved too soon. This tremendous loss has affected my children as well as myself.  I wanted to share an experience of utmost joy and connection through love and healing with them.  Everyone experiences loss in their lives. Death is a normal cycle of life that is heartbreaking.  The loss that is by suicide or early death is an especially hard one to bare.  My dad at fifty nine year old was the first committed suicide fourteen years ago out of the blue and it shook my entire family to the very core, including his beloved eight grandchildren and our whole community.  My younger brother at forty nine years old, along with five friends including my son's best friend a few months ago at nineteen years old have also done this.  Aunts, Uncles, family and friends that passed too soon from illness, covid, etc.  I consider this utopia part of our healing, to revisit and connect with our loved ones.  To be in the presence of light, love and peace.  To see my children happy, embracing those they loved so dear as well as myself.  Family, children, love, light, happiness, contentment, peace, giving and loving are my utopia. Being able to let go, knowing we will see them again.  To see my weenies, Puddles and Freckles again and all the other wonderful souls, including our pets  that have touched our lives brings such happiness to my soul.  How do I bring this to fruition in photo manipulation? I looked up images (1000 pixels) of people happy in a field with light around them.  Images of weenies that looked like my precious girls.  I wanted images that looked like they were somewhat floating happily in the direction of a field back to.  I copied and pasted many different images, light orbs and stars manipulated them to fit just right in my composition.  I wanted them to represent a peaceful presence of happiness, light and love.  I pictured in my mind seeing my dad, brother, grandparents, loved ones and feeling their loving arms around us with smiling faces.  The joy of their hug and smile, which we all miss.  The contentment and peace that would bring to myself and my children.  The trees and field regress into the night, with light orbs getting larger as they descend onto the field.  The large old trees that have fluorescents and bioluminescence give an ethereal atmosphere of wonder and fantasy.  The soft, bright light of the orbs is peaceful and calming.  Blurring the background gave a feeling of a dream. The feedback I received was many positive comments:  The way I manipulated the photo images told the story I was trying to convey.  They could tell what I was trying to convey right away.  Noticing that family is very important to me and a priority.  That love and peace are conveyed.  That the stars added depth to the composition.   The trees added whimsy and fantasy along with the light orbs.  How the light orbs descended and where laying in the field and we were moving toward the light.

Proposal
November 2, 2025

		            	“Experiment Three Video Proposal”



The title of my project is “YOLO” (You Only Live Once).  The premise of this idea is to create a dialogue with cutting film: such as Montage, matchcut, cut away, J-cut and possibly L-cut.  I will tell a story from beginning to end with my piece of video and audio clipped film.  I want the audience to come away with a sense of a little seed of knowledge; I have planted in their psyche, this seed is “Balance”.  As I age I am contemplating so much about my life and how to live the rest of it from this point on. I think when you have gone through a major life change, such as divorce and your whole life does a one hundred & eighty degree turn, you embrace it head on.  I tried to live this balance in my marriage and younger years with my children, to the best of my ability.  Unfortunately, there were roadblocks keeping me from “balancing” as I would have chosen to.  I did the best that I could and continue to do so to this day.  I want this to be a sort of helpful lesson in enjoying life, in continuum with marriage, children, daily grind of work, school, family and life, stress in general.  That you and your family’s mental health is as important as any other area in one’s life.  Do not wait for someday, because you never know when illness, death and life circumstances will change.  In my two minute audio/video creation, I will show by my editing, the idea of why, when and how balance might be achieved.  These thoughts and similar experiences of my own will guide me in choosing which original video clips to use.  Along with selected audio clips to help with the (dialogue) I am trying to achieve in my project.  My hope is that this idea of “YOLO” and the life balance they view will stay in the back of their mind.  As they continue on with their lives and they change, perhaps this idea will pop in their thoughts?   I will have hopefully made a positive impact in their future happiness. These lessons I have learned, I also pass on to my own children, my most important audience.

				“Video Editing, Project 3”
					Reflection, “YOLO”


When first thinking about this assignment, I was not sure what I should pick for a topic at first.  I watched about three hours of video clips to find and choose a narrative.  At first I was going to do clips of people enjoying various levels of recreation.   As I was porousing the plethora of video clips I had an epiphany.  I wanted to express the importance of social/emotional/mental health of the family unit in today’s world.  I always wanted to travel with my personal family together because I was not able to in my own childhood.  I grew up on a dairy farm with 150 cows, so there was no family vacationing. I always said to myself and my boyfriend who became my husband that family travel was very important to me. Unfortunately this did not happen and the balances that are so important in family life suffer.   I feel I achieved this narrative by editing, cutting and adding many video clips from the video archive that you suggested for us to use (Prelinger Video Archives).  I started by identifying video clips that were relative to my story line and saving them on the Premiere Pro.  I then isolated the clips by second to extract just the right video sequence that I needed for that particular scene of the narrative.  My narrative which I feel was successful, started as everyday life, work, family, school, parenting and sports.  The rigors of life and the need for balance to avoid burnout and overwhelming stressors of life that affect the family unit.  I tried to show the negative, the positive by video J-cutting and adding video at just the right times along the timeline to coincide with my narrative.  After entering the video sequencing clips, I went back and deleted most of the sound clips.  I then looked up on Google for free sound downloads, downloaded and added these specific sound clips into my video timeline to coincide with the clips.  I used sound clips as accurate to the video clip as possible to create the desired effect I was looking for.  I also used some of the sound/music that was in the original video clip and tried to voice over using my own voice and narrative for some of the timeline.  Next time I would separate the music from the voice over, It was harder to distinguish my voice speaking than I thought it would be.  I also think that my voice level may have been an issue because I was recording it in class and didn’t want to be too loud and disturb my classmates.  The feedback I received at critique was all around positive, which I felt good about.  This to me said they understood my narrative and it was successful.  A peer mentioned they liked the fact that I used my own voice in some of the sound clips to narrate the video.  I did this because I thought it would have more of an impact on the audience in the scene and I couldn’t find the exact words from a clip I was looking for.  The comments were that they liked the narrative and they understood it.  They said that I showed how hectic life can be and vacation with children as well.  I replied,” Yes but the hectic is a different kind of hectic and vacationing with children as a family unit is worth it”.  I wanted to show the memories made and the priceless time that you can never recover with your family when children are still young is so important to overall social/emotional health.”  Reflecting on this project, my hope is that my classmates take away the overall message and apply it to their future family lives, afterall “You Only Live Once”.
