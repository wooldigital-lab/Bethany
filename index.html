2D Project Statement
September 13, 2025
My vision for this 2D logo project of the Southworth Planetarium at the University of Southern Maine, Portland Campus, is to create a modern contemporary design in my logo.  I feel this will appeal to a wider audience of different ages.  Looking at various internet logos, Maine landmarks and Pinterest aesthetic ideas along with the Planetariums website and impact statement helped facilitate my inspiration. I want my design to invoke curiosity, interest and investigation.  Keeping my design simple but impactful I believe gives its composition straightforwardness and clarity. The audience interaction when they look at my logo should be “Wow that looks like something interesting we should check out”.  This could be for a teenage or adult date night, a birthday party, school educational field trip or a fun family learning activity. The shape of my logo is three quarters around with a planet like aesthetic, with a sun and its rays spanning the remaining one quarter of the planet.  I chose an abstract modern style in the images of the adults, adolescent and small child.  On the clothing of the adults are logos of the Maine Lobster representing the State of Maine’s symbolism and the USM logo for the geographical city of Portland symbolism.  I want the audience to see that the Southworth Planetarium is a fun place for educational outreach for all ages and families.  Creating a sense of wonder with their hands in the air as if they are looking to space and the stars (infant with a Saturn balloon). The sun, sunrays and cascading falling stars invite imagination and knowledge exploration, radiating down from space to the audience.  The colors I chose are the strong values, hues and saturations of the Hux Codes of Blue and Gold of USM.  I chose to use those particular colors to accentuate a sense of place, that the Southworth Planetarium is part of the campus in Portland, ME.  My goal for this logo is to promote the Planetarium in a positive, contemporary vibe of interest.  This could be used for advertising purposes on the internet website and advertising platform for the State of Maine, along with the Portland Tourism site.  Gift shop revenue ideas for the logo of  letter head, stationary, t-shirts, hats, pins, postcards, sweatshirts, stickers and on gift cards.

Digital Design Reflection 1
Southworth Planetarium
September 28, 2025
My first Digital Design project was making a Logo for the Southworth Planetarium on the University of Southern Maine’s Portland Campus.  I started to research for ideas and inspiration by looking at their web site for their motto and updated available programming.  I found this very helpful in forming my inspiration for my proposed logo. In searching for ideas from their website I thought about space, our solar system in general and what a planetarium’s purpose is.  I also looked up inspiration on the internet of our solar system and I specifically chose a round logo composition for the planet effect.  The round shape is also in consideration of the inside dome encapsulating our universe. The sunburst that encompasses the upper quarter of the logo was used to emphasize the sun’s place in our solar system;  the elongated sunbeams are meant to enunciate the outreach of the planetarium's solar system education.  I felt this was a very important focal point for the logo, since their focus is on educational outreach.  The open space beyond the upper sunbeams is left blank to suggest the vastness of our universe.  The yellow/gold shooting star juxtaposed on the atmosphere is to promote the exploration and wonder of our skies.  I chose the University of Southern Maine’s School color of blue and gold/yellow to represent the planetarium’s connection and presence at the university. I searched for the color codes on the university web site.  I also researched the Maine connection and a symbol that would be universally recognized as Maine. I chose the symbol of the Maine Lobster as well as the Emblem of the university to represent that the planetarium is on the campus of USM in Maine.  I wanted to specifically connect the educational outreach programs into the logo.  I used white figures of a family with arms raised as if in wonder and excitement enjoying the programming.  The figures range from the father, older child or teen, adolescent and mother holding a toddler.  I chose these particular figures because their programming is for adults, teens, adolescent children, schools and toddlers.  I designed the back of the shirts of the parents with the logos of USM and Maine Lobster.  I did this with the idea of promoting both of those images for local communities and tourism on the internet.  I added the Saturn planet balloon in the toddlers hand to promote fun, a kid friendly atmosphere and accentuate a gift shop opportunity.  The critique I received from classmates was overall very positive.  They all enjoyed the sun/sunbeams as the focal point and liked the round logo composition.  There were differing opinions on the lobster logo, some liked it, others liked it but not the addition of the red color.  They felt the color should be monotone, to be more cohesive.  They all liked the figures and colors I chose to symbolize programming. The Saturn balloon was liked by some, commenting it anchored the symmetry of the logo; others felt it wasn’t accurate in color.  A few comments were given that they really liked my design.  There was a comment that it could be scaled down even more simplified using the sun more as the focal point.  I do agree that these are all changes that would work with the design.  I did not go even simpler with the design for the horizontal, thinking the logo wouldn’t represent the planetarium’s mission of educational outreach for all ages.
