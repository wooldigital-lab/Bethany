2D Project Statement
September 13, 2025
My vision for this 2D logo project of the Southworth Planetarium at the University of Southern Maine, Portland Campus, is to create a modern contemporary design in my logo.  I feel this will appeal to a wider audience of different ages.  Looking at various internet logos, Maine landmarks and Pinterest aesthetic ideas along with the Planetariums website and impact statement helped facilitate my inspiration. I want my design to invoke curiosity, interest and investigation.  Keeping my design simple but impactful I believe gives its composition straightforwardness and clarity. The audience interaction when they look at my logo should be “Wow that looks like something interesting we should check out”.  This could be for a teenage or adult date night, a birthday party, school educational field trip or a fun family learning activity. The shape of my logo is three quarters around with a planet like aesthetic, with a sun and its rays spanning the remaining one quarter of the planet.  I chose an abstract modern style in the images of the adults, adolescent and small child.  On the clothing of the adults are logos of the Maine Lobster representing the State of Maine’s symbolism and the USM logo for the geographical city of Portland symbolism.  I want the audience to see that the Southworth Planetarium is a fun place for educational outreach for all ages and families.  Creating a sense of wonder with their hands in the air as if they are looking to space and the stars (infant with a Saturn balloon). The sun, sunrays and cascading falling stars invite imagination and knowledge exploration, radiating down from space to the audience.  The colors I chose are the strong values, hues and saturations of the Hux Codes of Blue and Gold of USM.  I chose to use those particular colors to accentuate a sense of place, that the Southworth Planetarium is part of the campus in Portland, ME.  My goal for this logo is to promote the Planetarium in a positive, contemporary vibe of interest.  This could be used for advertising purposes on the internet website and advertising platform for the State of Maine, along with the Portland Tourism site.  Gift shop revenue ideas for the logo of  letter head, stationary, t-shirts, hats, pins, postcards, sweatshirts, stickers and on gift cards.
